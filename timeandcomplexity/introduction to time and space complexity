how to analyze time complexity
for analyzing time complexity in a program we have to check the no. of operation is going to be performed in a programme


Tyoes of time complexity are:
1. Worst case time complexity:_ in this type of operation programme take more time as compare to the time it has to find the solution
   It is represented by the O(n)

2.Best case time complexity:_ in this type of operation the programme take the minimu time to find the solution
    It is represented by the omega(1)

3.Average time complexity:_ in this type of operation program is executed many time to check the average time it takes to find the solution
    It is represented by the theta(n)

    Now Space complexity
It is defined as the extara memeory of the program and Space used in the program directly proportional to the time it has to find the solution
